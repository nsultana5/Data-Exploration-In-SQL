# Overview

This project aims to explore and analyze COVID-19 data to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic on various aspects such as infection rates, healthcare systems, and socio-economic factors. By leveraging SQL queries, we examine datasets to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations that can inform decision-making and public health strategies.
# Data Sources

Analyzing data sources from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths to understand the progression and impact of COVID-19 across different regions and timeframes.

# Objectives

Analyze trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries over time. -Investigate the relationship between COVID-19 metrics and demographic variables. -Explore the impact of interventions (e.g., lockdowns, vaccinations) on the spread of the virus. -Identify regional disparities and hotspots of infection.

#Methodologies

## Steps -1

## Data Cleaning:

- The Covid data from 'OurWorldData' is cleaned and converted into 2 different datasets using Excel.
- Covid Deaths Dataset - Contains the data about Covid deaths in the world till Dec 2023.
- Covid Vaccinations Dataset - Contains the Vaccinations data till DEC 2023.

## Steps-2
## Data Exploartion:

Data Exploration is performed using MS-SQL Utilizing SQL's powerful querying capabilities to extract, transform, and visualize COVID-related data, aiming to derive valuable insights for decision-makers and the community. Leveraging SQL's functionalities for aggregations joins, and statistical analysis to comprehend the multifaceted aspects of the pandemic.
